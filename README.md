# 🤖 AI Excuse Detector & Roaster 📝🔥

Tired of bad excuses? This Streamlit app uses an AI agent to **detect excuses, classify them, explain why, and roast them** with humor, sarcasm, and a touch of brainrot energy.  

Whether it’s “Wi-Fi died” or “a seagull stole my laptop,” the AI will let you know if it’s **believable, nonsense, or just plain suspicious** — and then make fun of you for trying.
